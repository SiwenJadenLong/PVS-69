# PVS-69

__Disclaimer__: This project is experimental, still in development, and is recommended for experienced tinkerers and moderate solderers. Don't let that disuade you, but know that documentation, methods, and peocedures are not production ready.

[Frequently Asked Questions can be found here.](https://github.com/knack-69/PVS-69/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions)

### What is it?
PVS-69 is a FOSSCAD Monocular Night Vision Device (MNVD). 
It uses a fpv drone camera and a small screen, rather than a IIT tube, and is designed to be mounted to a combat helmet.

### Why is it useful?
The current suggested components cost ~$400, about 10x less than the industry standard phosphor tube-based version.

### What is the current version?
The current version of the PVS-69 is the [Gen3 ECHO](https://github.com/knack-69/PVS-69/tree/main/PVS-69%20versions/Gen3%20ECHO). However, if you are using the newer 44.6mm OD V780 display, you will want to use the [Gen3 FOXTROT](https://github.com/knack-69/PVS-69/tree/FOXTROT-V780/Gen3%20FOXTROT). The Gen3 FOXTROT also comes with a CS Mount Lens Adapter Assembly ([see here for writeup on lenses](https://github.com/knack-69/PVS-69/wiki/Current-Lens-Comparison)), which is interchangable with the NE3 Stock Lens Cap.
