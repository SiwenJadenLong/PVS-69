PVS-69 GEN3 Delta. 

this design requires the following printed components: 

1X Dovetail

1X Bridge

2X Sensor caps (foxeer or runcam)please note there are +0 and +2. 
I prefer using the +2 as it wides fov and gives me a better view of the tube.

1X right tube

1X left tube or a DVR tube. 

1X Battery cover

1X Backplate.


For physical components you will need the following

11X M5x7 heat set insert

11X M5x8 bolts. (for the dovetail a button head is reccomend) 

2X starlight FPV cameras. runcam or foxeer work in this design.

2X V760A-5 or V760A-3 displays. these can be found on ebay, expect a month for shipping

1X 3 position rotary switch. I use "Rotary Switch 16MM Selector Switch 3 Position Select Switch"
this can be found on amazon sold in a 2 pack

1X 300x8mm OD of brass tubing. you will only use 100mm

1X 5.5x2.1mm DC female jack. this can also be found on amazon. i used the plastic one they are sold in a 5 pack
