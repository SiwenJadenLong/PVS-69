PVS-69 Gen3 CHARLIE

==========================================

Note:
If using the .3mf, the TIPs (Tube Interface Piece) present are, from top to bottom: +0°, +2°, +7°.

==========================================

This design requires the following printed components: 

1x Dovetail

1x Bridge

2x Sensor caps (foxeer or runcam)

2x TIPs. Please note there are +0°, +2°, and +7° variants. 
         I prefer using the +2 as it wides fov and gives me a better view of the tube.

2x Ambi tubes

2x Collars

1x Battery cover

1x Backplate

==========================================

For physical components you will need the following

11x M5x7 heat set insert

11x M5x8 bolts. (for the dovetail a button head is recommended)

2x Starlight FPV cameras. RunCam Night Eagle 3 or Foxeer Cat 3 work in this design.

1x 300x8mm OD of brass tubing. you will only use 100mm

1x 5.5x2.1mm DC female jack. This can also be found on Amazon. I used the plastic ones sold in a 5 pack

1x AA battery terminals. these are sold in a 20 pack

1x Buck Converter. I used the eBoot Mini MP1584EN DC-DC Buck Converter Adjustable Power Supply Module (6 Pack)
