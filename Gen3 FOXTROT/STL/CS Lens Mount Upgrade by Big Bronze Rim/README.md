These files are an upgrade to the CS Lens Mount files for the Gen3 FOXTROT. They include 4 files.
 - CS_Focus_Insert
    This slots into the Camera hole of the Gen3 FOXTROT Ambi Tube
 - CS_Tapered_Retaining_Collar
    This 
 - PVS14_Focus_Ring_Outer
    This acts the same as the CS_Lens_Mount_Shroud.stl, but is a bit larger
 - Ribbed_CS_Spacer
    This is functionally the same as the CS_Lens_Mount_Adapter.stl, but is ribbed for aesthetics
