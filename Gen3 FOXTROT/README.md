# PVS-69 Gen3 FOXTROT

## Changes from ECHO to FOXTROT

The PVS-69 Gen3 FOXTROT is currently in beta testing. Take that as a word of caution. Please read all the changes.

(Beta testing) FOXTROT changes:
Expanded inner bore for use with V780 display.

Condensed overall pod length but moved the display bore deeper in the pod.

Opened up the area where the cam connector goes to accommodate more cams.

Added area for the OSD cable to come out the front.

Added CS mount quick change system. Still usable with the classic caps (Called 'NE3 Stock Sensor Cap' in .step)

Added holes to screw the sensor down for the lens quick change system.

New Gen4 Bridge (front load) does not require brass tubing however, should be able to accept it.

Both bridges now support the use of M3 bolts to individually adjust pod tightness.

Both bridges have a push-to overcome-latch to stow the tubes to the side.

Battery bridge has been slimmed down slightly more to accomadate narrower IPD, might need some tweaking.

As for the CS Mount Lens deal, basically, you can either use the NE3 Stock Lens (or XENOCAM Varifocus lens) *or* you can use the CS Mount Lens with the 'CS Mount Lens Assembly' (in the .step). [See this wiki page for links to the different lenses.](https://github.com/knack-69/PVS-69/wiki/Current-Lens-Comparison). If you aren't planning on using the CS mount lens, don't print the 'CS Mount Lens Assembly' items. ezpz

## Bill of Materials 

### This design requires the following printed components: 

1x [Dovetail](https://github.com/knack-69/PVS-69/blob/main/Gen3%20FOXTROT/STL/FOXTROT%20Gen4%20Dovetail.stl)

1x Bridge Body. In this design, there are 3 Bridge options:
1. Gen3 Bridge is the same bridge as older versions, with an internal battery compartment.
2. [Gen4 Bridge](https://github.com/knack-69/PVS-69/blob/main/Gen3%20FOXTROT/STL/FOXTROT%20Gen4%20Bridge%20Body.stl) is a newer, sleeker bridge that does *not* have an internal battery compartment. This version allows the user to more easily build the internals of the bridge and then load it into the front.

1x Bridge Backplate, which will depend on the Bridge body you choose

2x Sensor Caps - This will depend on whether you're using stock, CS Mount, M16, or some other lenses.

2x [TIPs (Tube Interface Pieces)](https://github.com/knack-69/PVS-69/blob/main/Gen3%20FOXTROT/STL/FOXTROT%20Brassless%20TIP.stl)

2x Ambi Tubes

1x Battery Cap (Only needed if using Gen3 Bridge)

2x Collars
